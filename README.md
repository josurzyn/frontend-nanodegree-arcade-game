frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This Arcade Game project is part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree. It's a complete arcade game based on the classic Frogger, coded using the Udacity starter files and game loop engine.

## Instructions

### How to run

To run the game, download or clone the repo and open index.html in a browser.

### How to play

The goal of the game is to make it to the water without colliding with any of the enemy bugs. Each time you reach the water, you gain 1000 points and the player is reset to the start position - see how high you can get your score! After each successful run, the game will get a little harder, with more bugs appearing and their speed slowly increasing. During the game, special items will appear on the board - collect them for bonus points.

You lose if you collide with an enemy bug and the game will be reset. You can see a summary of your most recent and highest scores for your current session in the Scoreboard.

Use the up, down, left and right keyboard buttons to move the character around the board.
